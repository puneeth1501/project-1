        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Experience seamless 3D printing with The 3D Craft House, where we transform your concepts into tangible creations. Here’s how you can bring your project to life with us:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 1: Describe Your Product</strong><br />
            Provide a detailed description of the product you want to create. Specify the material (PLA, clay, or stoneware) and choose your desired colors. The more details you provide, the better we can serve your needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 2: Receive a Quote</strong><br />
            Once we understand your requirements, we’ll assess the project scope and provide you with a detailed quote, including the estimated time for completion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 3: Confirm Your Order</strong><br />
            After reviewing the quote, you can confirm your order. We will then send you an invoice for the payment, which you can complete to move forward with the printing process.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 4: Collection or Delivery</strong><br />
            Upon completion of your 3D print, we’ll contact you to arrange for either pickup from our Hyderabad location or delivery to your address.
