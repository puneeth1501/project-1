            <h2>What is 3D Printing?</h2>
            <p>3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is a revolutionary technology that creates three-dimensional objects from digital designs. By adding material layer by layer, it allows for complex shapes and structures that would be difficult or impossible to achieve with traditional manufacturing methods.</p>

            <h2>How Does 3D Printing Work?</h2>
            <p>Design: Everything starts with a digital design, created in a 3D modeling program or scanned with a 3D scanner.
                Preparation: The design is then processed by slicing software that divides it into thousands of thin layers and prepares it for printing.
                Printing: The printer builds the object layer by layer. The material—plastic, metal, or resin—is extruded through a heated nozzle, solidifying to form the final product.
                Post-processing: Some prints may require cleaning, sanding, or painting to achieve the desired finish.</p>
